We will use the rolling update feature available in deployments

First we need to increase no of replicas atleast 2, Inside the .yaml file for deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  
Inside the .yaml file for deployment we will specify inside labels
labels:
        app: <app_name>
        role: rolling-update
        
        so when we change the DI, pod updates one by one according to the new image
