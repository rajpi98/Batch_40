From inside the cluster try accessing the pod using curl<IP>:port

  If not able to hit the pod, it means, port specified is wrong
  
  open the .yaml file
  
  see the field of port
  
  ports:
 - port: <>
   protocol: TCP
   targetPort: 8000    -----> any request to incoming port will be forwarded to pods listening on this port
   
   check for ports that have been mentioned, see if there is a mismatch
   
   no of ports can also be increased
